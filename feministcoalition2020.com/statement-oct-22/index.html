            <h2>A Statement from the Feminist Coalition</h2>

            <p>The Feminist Coalition condemns every form of violence and believes that no Nigerian life is worth losing to senseless violence. We are young Nigerians with hopes, dreams and aspirations for our country. This means we need to stay alive to pursue our dreams to build the future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The past two weeks have been tough for many Nigerians, most especially the last two days. Many lives have been lost and properties destroyed at the height of what started as peaceful marches for the end to police brutality. The Feminist Coalition condoles with every Nigerian mother, father, son, daughter who has lost a loved one in these trying times. These Nigerians share the same vision for a better country as we all do and should be duly recognized as heroes. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We are merchants of hope. Our priority is always the welfare and safety of the Nigerian youth. Following the President’s address, we hereby encourage all young Nigerians to stay safe, stay home, and observe the mandated curfew in your state. The Feminist Coalition has made a decision to henceforth stop all donation inflows for the #EndSARS peaceful protest. The rest of the donations will go towards funding medical emergencies, legal aid for wrongfully detained citizens, and relief for victims of police brutality and families of the deceased.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is a summary of the total funds we received and disbursed (in Naira) over the past 14 days:  </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Total received = ₦147,855,788.28 (includes donations in USD, CAD, GBP, EUR, GHS, KES, and BTC)<br>
Total disbursed = ₦60,403,235.00<br>
Total left = ₦87,452,553.28
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The remaining funds will be channeled through the following initiatives/organizations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>#EndSARSresponse (Medical) - ₦20,114,087.25</li>
                <li>The Legal Aid Network - ₦15,741,459.59</li>
                <li>Relief for victims of police brutality and families of the deceased - ₦40,228,174.51</li>
                <li>Memorial for the Fallen - ₦5,247,153.197</li>
                <li>#EndSARSMentalHealthSupport - ₦6,121,678.73</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>We wish to emphasize that we will no longer be accepting donations for #EndSARS going forward. The Feminist Coalition remains committed to its core mandate, which is, championing the advancement of the Nigerian woman. We hope everyone will extend the same support we have received in the past two weeks towards pursuing this mandate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for the support.</p>
