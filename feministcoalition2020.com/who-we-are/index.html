            <h2>Who We Are</h2>

            <p>In July 2020, Damilola Odufuwa and Odunayo Eweniyi decided to come together to create a coalition of feminist women with a vision of a Nigeria where equality for all people is a reality in our laws and everyday lives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We approached 12 other exceptional women who were equally passionate about changing our country and the role of women in it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Together with these women we became the Feminist Coalition. The Feminist Coalition aims to further the rights of Nigerian women by focusing on three (3) pillars: women’s rights & safety, financial equality for women; and political & legislative power for women.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over the past week, with the peaceful uprising by the Nigerian youth around #EndSARS, we decided our first project for the Feminist Coalition would be to help fight injustice through fundraising in order to sustain the peaceful protests and ensure the safety of Nigerians exercising their constitutional rights - by providing food, water and other refreshments, masks, medical aid, security, information and legal aid for protesters. The funds raised for this #EndSars project by Feminist Coalition are seperate from and independent of any funds raised by any other entities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We’re committed to helping the Nigerian youth amplify their voices, as we collectively demand an end to injustice. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for the support.</p>
